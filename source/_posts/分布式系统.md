# CAP Theorem, Web Caching, Consistent Hashing
## CAP Theorem
### Atomic Register
- The register is replicated and distributed, but must maintain consistency and availability across all replicas.  
- Describes many distribted systems
- It is impossible for an atomic register to maintain the **three guarantees simultaneously**  

### C\-A\-P: Choose <u>two</u> out of <u>three</u>*
#### <u>C</u>onsistency
- All read requests should read the latest value (or return an error)
- Definition
  - Refers to **replication consistency**
  - Ideally means **strict consistency**
  - Assumed to be **linearizability**
  - This usually means replication across sites should be done **eagerly**  

#### <u>A</u>vailability
- All requests should return successfully (if possible)
- Definition
  - **Every request** received by a non-failed node must result in a **non-error response**
    - **Non-triviality** requirement: a system which always responds with errors is not available
  - Assumes as **crash failure** model for processes
    - **Functioning nodes** must continue to operate even if there are **failed machies**
  - No requirement on latency: response can be very slow
  - Both a **weak and strong** definition: no latency guarantee, but 100% response success  

#### <u>P</u>artition\-Tolerance
- The system can tolerate arbitrary number of communication failures

### CAP vs. FLP


## Web Caching
### Definition
**unpredictable delays** and **failures**
#### Caching to the rescue
### Hierarchy
#### Single, shared caching machine
#### Proxy server
#### Trade-offs
#### Content-delivery network (CDN)

## Consistent Hashing
